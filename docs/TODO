These are listed from most important to least important.

Add a factoid search feature.
Add in the org.omg URLs - maybe srclist.txt could be generated with a handy wget.
If someone forgets the 'javadoc' part of ~javadoc SomeClass, be lenient.
Make the javadoc URLs capable of coming from more places than just java.sun.com.
Make javabot interact with the pastebin to notify on pastes.
Make the access control lists more useful.
Make fun of people who log in as root on IRC (requested by Twiun).
Add a version entry to reflect the svn revision number javabot was built against.  and probably a date.
