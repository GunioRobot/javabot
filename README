Javabot is a bot for IRC

Copy config.xml.sample to config.xml (cp config.xml.sample config.xml)

Edit config.xml, following the instructions in the comments (everything between <!-- and --> in that file).

Run ant from the root (e.g., cd /home/me/javabot; ant), then run ./restart.sh

You might need to make restart.sh executable before this will work (chmod +x restart.sh).

Good luck, and drop us a line at ricky_clarkson@yahoo.com and javabot@cheeseronline.org with any feedback/patches.
