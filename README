Javabot is a bot for IRC

Copy config.xml.sample to config.xml (cp config.xml.sample config.xml)

Edit config.xml, following the instructions in the comments (everything between <!-- and --> in that file).

Once you have these files edited, pop them into the userspace of the user running
javabot (NOT ROOT) in .javabot/file.etc and so on.
